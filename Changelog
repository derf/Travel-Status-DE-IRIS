Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.22 - Sun Dec 16 2018

    * Add delay code 4 (unforeseen staff shortage, thanks to Fabian Schwarz)
    * Add delay code (technical failure in carriage, thanks to @marudor)

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.21 - Sun Sep 09 2018

    * Fix crash when receiving invalid XML due to network issues

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.20 - Mon Aug 06 2018

    * Use schedule instead of realtime data when determining whether a train
      falls within the lookahead time frame. This fixes severely delayed
      trains being ignored even if their scheduled arrival/departure is very
      soon or has already passed.

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.19 - Wed Aug 01 2018

    * db-iris: Fix "-ot" ignoring arrival delay if departure is on time
    * Add delay code 12 (waiting for passengers in a ship)

    * Result: New accessors arrival_delay and departure_delay

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.18 - Mon Apr 23 2018

    * Update station dataset to Open Data Haltestellenliste 2017-09

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.17 - Sat Apr 14 2018

    * db-iris: Support -d/--date "tomorrow"

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.16 - Sat Jul 08 2017

    * Fix miscalculated delays of prematurely terminating trains
    * Lookahead and lookbehind are now interpreted with 1-minute granularity.
      Note that this also affects the default lookahead.
    * Fix floating point-related test failures on some architectures
    * New "./Build test" dependency: Test::Number::Delta

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.15 - Tue Jun 06 2017

    * Performance improvements
    * Distinguish between cancelled/additional arrivals and departures
    * Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::Result: New accessors arrival_is_additional,
      arrival_is_cancelled, departure_is_additional, departure_is_cancelled
      and is_additional.
    * Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::Result: is_cancelled now only returns true
      if both arrival and departure have been cancelled.

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.14 - Mon Feb 06 2017

    * IRIS->new: Add optional argument lookbehind
    * db-iris: Remove a useless HTTP request, resulting in slightly faster
               responses
    * db-iris -V / --track-via: Improve support for faraway stations

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.13 - Thu Jan 26 2017

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.12 - Fri Dec 30 2016

    * Unfortunately, line numbers are not available at the moment due to IRIS
      backend changes. Some lines in NRW have been provided with a manual line
      number mapping to remedy this.
    * Fix DS100 code for "Bielefeld Hbf"
    * Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::Stations::get_station_by_location: Fix bug in
      num_matches (parameter was silently ignored)

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.11 - Tue Oct 11 2016

    * IRIS->new: Fix partially broken cache handling when using
      "with_related => 1"
    * Improve parser performance

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.10 - Sat Oct 01 2016

    * Add qos code 71 ("WLAN in einzelnen Wagen nicht verfügbar")
    * Fix DS100 codes for "Geilenkirchen" and "Montabaur"
    * Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::Stations::get_station: Add support for
      UIC / EVA numbers

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.09 - Mon Jun 27 2016

    * Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::Result: Fix ->classes accessor
      (returned a string instead of a list)
    * Fix DS100 codes for "Stuttgart Hbf (tief)" and "Stuttgart-Feuerbach"


Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.08 - Thu Jun 09 2016

    * New dependency: Geo::Distance
    * Update DS100 code list. Station names are now unabbreviated, e.g.
      "Dortmund Univeristät" instead of "Do Universität". Also, stations
      without train service are no longer included. Note that this list might
      contain errors. If you get "Request error: Station ... has no associated
      timetable" for a station which worked with previous versions, please
      submit a bug report.
    * Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::Stations now also returns international
      station number, longitude and latitutde for most stations
    * New method Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::Stations::get_station_by_location
      allows station lookup by geolocation

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.07 - Sun May 01 2016

    * Fix inefficient requests for stations with with heavily cross-referenced
      related-station tags (most notable example: München Hbf)

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.06 - Mon Feb 29 2016

    * Partially fix slow response time and excessive network requests for
      stations with heavily cross-referenced related-station tags (most notable
      example: München Hbf). The implementation is still slightly inefficient
      in these cases, but far better than before -- A complete fix will follow
      in the next release. Note that db-iris calls using
      -x/--exact/--no-related are not affected by this issue.

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.05 - Sun Dec 20 2015

    * Update station list. It now uses data supplied by the Deutsche Bahn
      Open Data portal.
    * db-iris: New option -x / --exact / --no-related
    * IRIS->new: New options main_cache, realtime_cache and with_related
    * IRIS: Add ->station and ->related_stations accessors
    * db-iris: Include related stations in query output (for instance,
      "Köln Messe Deutz" will include "Köln Messe Deutz (tief)" and
      "Köln Messe Deutz Gl. 9-10"). Use --exact / --no-related to disable this.
    * IRIS: Same. Also, IRIS->new can now be passed Cache objects to cache
      HTTP requests for a user-defined time. This is most useful when
      building infoscreens and similar, since the scheduled and station data
      never changes and can therefore be cached to decrease network load and
      increase response time.

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.04 - Thu Nov 12 2015

    * Result: Add qos code 79 ("Ohne Mehrzweckabteil")
    * db-iris: Accept UIC station codes

      drop-in replacements)

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 0.10 - Tue Apr 30 2015

    * Result: Fix deep recursion error in TO_JSON

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 0.09 - Tue Apr 28 2015

    * Result: Add arrival_wings, departure_wings and is_wing accessors
      (a wing train is coupled to the respective departure, but has its own ID)
    * db-iris: Indicate wings in output
    * Result: Remove train_no_transfer accessor (was based on erroneous
      assumptions)
    * Result: Add is_unscheduled, replaced_by and replacement_for accessors
    * db-iris: Add -oR to show replacement information

    * Fix --track-via <stop> not matching trains changing their ID at <stop>
    * Add new (not entirely verified) IRIS delay and qos messages
    * IRIS: add serializable option. Use this if you intend to serialize
