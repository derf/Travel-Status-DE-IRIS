Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.35 - Sun Nov 17 2019

    * Add additional dutch and austrian stations
      (thanks to https://github.com/Knuspel)
    * Add geocoordinates for several of those
      (thanks to https://github.com/Knuspel)

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.34 - Sat Oct 19 2019

    * Improve request speed when using with_related by ignoring
      subway stations which do not have results anyways (e.g. in Hannover Hbf)
    * Do not forward unexpected IRIS message codes (ID ≥ 100) to the user
    * IRIS: Add ->related_stations accessor

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.33 - Sat Oct 05 2019

    * Fix $result->route_pre / route_post accessors providing bogus data
      when all previous/following stops are cancelled. They used to return
      sched_route_pre / sched_route_post instead of an empty list in this case.

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.32 - Thu Aug 22 2019

    * Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::Stations: Add geocoordinates fo some swiss
      and austrian stations

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.31 - Thu Aug 08 2019

    * Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::Stations: Add EVA/UIC station numbers and use
      full names for non-german stations.

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.30 - Wed Jul 17 2019

    * Result: Add ->station and ->station_uic accessors. These are useful to
      determine which station an individual train belongs to when requesting
      departures of multiple stations at once using the "with_related" option.

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.29 - Tue Jul 09 2019

    * Add QoS code 72 (no info/entertainment system available)
    * Fix erroneous QoS codes 83, 91, 92

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.28 - Sun Jun 23 2019

    * Add 234 stations missing from regular DB Open Data station list
    * Add delay code 14 (Technische Störung am Bahnhof)

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.26 - Fri May 31 2019

    * Fix DS100 code for Berlin Westkreuz
    * Add station Bonn UN Campus

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.25 - Mon Apr 29 2019

    * Do not ignore trains with arrival < lookahead, even if departure >=
      lookahead.
    * Add delay code 66 (flooded area)

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.24 - Sat Mar 02 2019

    * Remove erroneous double entry for Düsseldorf-Bilk
    * Fix a warning when encountering unusual train types

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.23 - Sat Dec 29 2018

    * Ignore apparently useless "ZOB" (central omnibus station) links at most
      main stations. This decreases the average runtime and also fixes
      some S-Bahn trains being reported twice in München Hbf.
    * Result->qos_messages: Skip superseded messages. They're still present in
      ->messages.
    * Result->route_interesting: Filter Hbf suffixes (not just "Hbf"); include
      .hl.n (czech main station).

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.22 - Sun Dec 16 2018

    * Add delay code 4 (unforeseen staff shortage, thanks to Fabian Schwarz)

    * Fix crash when receiving invalid XML due to network issues

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.20 - Mon Aug 06 2018

    * Use schedule instead of realtime data when determining whether a train
      falls within the lookahead time frame. This fixes severely delayed
      trains being ignored even if their scheduled arrival/departure is very
      soon or has already passed.

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.19 - Wed Aug 01 2018

    * db-iris: Fix "-ot" ignoring arrival delay if departure is on time

    * db-iris: Support -d/--date "tomorrow"

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.16 - Sat Jul 08 2017

    * Fix miscalculated delays of prematurely terminating trains
    * Lookahead and lookbehind are now interpreted with 1-minute granularity.
      Note that this also affects the default lookahead.
    * Fix floating point-related test failures on some architectures
    * New "./Build test" dependency: Test::Number::Delta

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.15 - Tue Jun 06 2017

    * Performance improvements
    * Distinguish between cancelled/additional arrivals and departures
    * Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::Result: New accessors arrival_is_additional,
      arrival_is_cancelled, departure_is_additional, departure_is_cancelled
      and is_additional.
    * Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::Result: is_cancelled now only returns true
      if both arrival and departure have been cancelled.

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.14 - Mon Feb 06 2017

    * IRIS->new: Add optional argument lookbehind
    * db-iris: Remove a useless HTTP request, resulting in slightly faster
               responses
    * db-iris -V / --track-via: Improve support for faraway stations

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.13 - Thu Jan 26 2017

    * Fix support for line numbers, remove manual line map workaround

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.12 - Fri Dec 30 2016

    * Unfortunately, line numbers are not available at the moment due to IRIS
      backend changes. Some lines in NRW have been provided with a manual line
      number mapping to remedy this.
    * Fix DS100 code for "Bielefeld Hbf"
    * Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::Stations::get_station_by_location: Fix bug in
      num_matches (parameter was silently ignored)

    * IRIS->new: Fix partially broken cache handling when using
      "with_related => 1"
    * Improve parser performance

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.10 - Sat Oct 01 2016

    * Add qos code 71 ("WLAN in einzelnen Wagen nicht verfügbar")
    * Fix DS100 codes for "Geilenkirchen" and "Montabaur"
    * Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::Stations::get_station: Add support for
      UIC / EVA numbers

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.09 - Mon Jun 27 2016

    * Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::Result: Fix ->classes accessor
      (returned a string instead of a list)
    * Fix DS100 codes for "Stuttgart Hbf (tief)" and "Stuttgart-Feuerbach"


Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.08 - Thu Jun 09 2016

    * New dependency: Geo::Distance
    * Update DS100 code list. Station names are now unabbreviated, e.g.
      "Dortmund Univeristät" instead of "Do Universität". Also, stations
      without train service are no longer included. Note that this list might
      contain errors. If you get "Request error: Station ... has no associated
      timetable" for a station which worked with previous versions, please
      submit a bug report.
    * Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::Stations now also returns international
      station number, longitude and latitutde for most stations
    * New method Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::Stations::get_station_by_location
      allows station lookup by geolocation

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.07 - Sun May 01 2016

    * Fix inefficient requests for stations with with heavily cross-referenced
      related-station tags (most notable example: München Hbf)

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.06 - Mon Feb 29 2016

    * Partially fix slow response time and excessive network requests for
      stations with heavily cross-referenced related-station tags (most notable
      example: München Hbf). The implementation is still slightly inefficient
      in these cases, but far better than before -- A complete fix will follow
      in the next release. Note that db-iris calls using
      -x/--exact/--no-related are not affected by this issue.

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.05 - Sun Dec 20 2015

    * Update station list. It now uses data supplied by the Deutsche Bahn
      Open Data portal.
    * db-iris: New option -x / --exact / --no-related
    * IRIS->new: New options main_cache, realtime_cache and with_related
    * IRIS: Add ->station and ->related_stations accessors
    * db-iris: Include related stations in query output (for instance,
      "Köln Messe Deutz" will include "Köln Messe Deutz (tief)" and
      "Köln Messe Deutz Gl. 9-10"). Use --exact / --no-related to disable this.
    * IRIS: Same. Also, IRIS->new can now be passed Cache objects to cache
      HTTP requests for a user-defined time. This is most useful when
      building infoscreens and similar, since the scheduled and station data
      never changes and can therefore be cached to decrease network load and
      increase response time.

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.04 - Thu Nov 12 2015

    * Result: Add qos code 79 ("Ohne Mehrzweckabteil")
    * db-iris: Accept UIC station codes

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 1.00 - Fri May 01 2015

    * IRIS->new: Use lwp_options to explicitly pass arguments to the
      LWP::UserAgent constructor. Unknown arguments are now longer
      implicitly passed on

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 0.10 - Tue Apr 30 2015

    * Result: Fix deep recursion error in TO_JSON

Travel::Status::DE::IRIS 0.09 - Tue Apr 28 2015

    * Result: Add arrival_wings, departure_wings and is_wing accessors
      (a wing train is coupled to the respective departure, but has its own ID)
    * db-iris: Indicate wings in output

      assumptions)
    * Result: Add is_unscheduled, replaced_by and replacement_for accessors
    * db-iris: Add -oR to show replacement information
