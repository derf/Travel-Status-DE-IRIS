Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::Stations - Station name to station code mapping

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::Stations;

    my $name = 'Essen Hbf';
    my @stations = Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::Stations::get_station_by_name(
      $name);

    }
    elsif (@stations > 1) {
      # too many matches
    }
    else {
      printf("Input '%s' matched station code %s (as '%s')\n",
        $name, @{$stations[0]});
    }

version 0.00

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains a mapping of DeutscheBahn station names to station codes.
A station name is a (perhaps slightly abbreviated) string naming a particular
station; a station code is a two to five character denoting a station for the
IRIS web service.

Example station names (code in parentheses) are:
"Essen HBf" (EE), "Aachen Schanz" (KASZ), "Do UniversitE<auml>t" (EDUV).

B<Note:> Station codes may contain whitespace.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::get_stations

Returns a list of [station code, station name] listrefs lexically sorted by
station name.

=item Travel::Status::DE::IRIS::get_station_by_name(I<$name>)

Returns a list of [station code, station name] listrefs where the station
name matches I<$name>.

Matching happens in two steps: If a case-insensitive exact match exists, only
this one is returned. Otherwise, all stations whose name contains I<$name> as
a substring (also case-insensitive) are returned.

This two-step behaviour makes sure that not prefix-free stations can still be
matched directly. For instance, both "Essen-Steele" and "Essen-Steele Ost"
are valid station names, but "essen-steele" will only return "Essen-Steele".
